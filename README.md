This is a Python-based programme that will generate and display truth-tables for expressions in proposition logic that contain as many as 8 individual atomic sentences/propositions.  

It will also be able to confirm the main logical operator. Unfortunately it cannot identify the main logical operator in cases where the main logical operator is used elsewhere in the expression as I could not find a reliable way to distinguishing this.

Stylistically, it takes after Anki in terms of font and UI. 

For usage pleasure ensure you have Python installed, and pip install sympy and PyQt5.
